# Python Introduction

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is simple to learn and widely used in areas such as **data science, machine learning, automation, and Generative AI**.  
Its clear syntax and powerful libraries make it the backbone of AI development, helping developers and researchers quickly test, build, and scale ideas.


## 1. Getting Started with Python

Python needs to be installed before writing programs. Once installed, the `print()` function is used to display output and the `input()` function is used to take user input. Variables act as storage for values, while keywords are reserved words that define Python’s structure.

## 2. Data and Decisions in Python

Python provides multiple data types like numbers, strings, lists, and dictionaries. Operators are symbols used to perform calculations or comparisons. Conditional statements such as `if`, `elif`, and `else` help programs make decisions based on conditions.

## 3. Loops and Functions

Loops repeat a block of code until a condition is met, making programs more efficient. Functions are reusable pieces of code that perform specific tasks, helping in writing cleaner and modular programs.

## 4. Strings and Lists

Strings are sequences of characters used to handle text. Lists are ordered collections that can store multiple items, making them useful for working with groups of data.

## 5. Dictionaries, Tuples and Sets

Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs for fast lookups. Tuples are ordered but immutable collections, while sets store unique items and are helpful when duplicates need to be removed.

## 6. Collections, Comprehensions and OOPs

The `collections` module extends Python’s built-in data structures with tools like `Counter` and `deque`. Comprehensions provide a shorter way to create lists, sets, or dictionaries. Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) introduces concepts like classes and objects to organize code.

## 7. Error Handling and Advanced Concepts

Errors can stop a program, and exception handling (`try-except`) helps manage them gracefully. Generators, decorators, and context managers are advanced features for handling data and resources efficiently. NumPy provides tools for numerical operations, while Pandas is widely used for data analysis and handling datasets.
